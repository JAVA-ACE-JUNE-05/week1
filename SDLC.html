    SDLC: software development life Cycle
     The SDLC is the standard process of creating, testing and deploying an information system. 

     1. Requirement Phase = This is where the requirements for the system are defined.
     2. Analytical Phase = This is where the technically team puts the conceptual requirements into 
        a technical context.
     3. Design Phase – Decisions on what tools, systems, architectures etc. 
        will be used by the development team for the system. 
     4. Development Phase – Code is actually written.
     5. Testing Phase – The built code is tested at various levels and environments to ensure 
        it functions as intended.
     6. Deployment/Maintenance Phase – The product/software/system is released to the end users 
        and then monitored to ensure its continued functionality.   
    
    ---------------------------SDLC IMPLEMENTATIONS:  ---------------------------------------------
    Waterfall: 
     o Traditional method of SDLC. 
     o One step is fully completed before the next step begins; you never return to a previous step.

        CONS:
     o Unexpected problems can be difficult to resolve because you are fined by previous decisions. 
     o Lacks flexibility to react to market changes or client demands. 
     o Considering the pros and cons Waterfall is best suited for small-scale projects with 
        highly static requirements and constraints.

    Agile:
      The steps of SDLC are done over and over again with pieces of the project.
      • Agile’s 4 principles: 
        o Prioritizing individuals and interactions above processes and tools. 
        o Working software over comprehensive documentation. 
        o Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 
        o Responding to change over following the plan. 
        
      Pros:  
        o Flexibility
        o Communication, especially with the end-client, makes for more functional and tailored applications
        o Early testing can find and resolve problems quickly and efficiently.

    Scrum:
     Scrum is the most popular Agile implementation.
     Scrum divides the project timeline into 2-4 week “sprints”

     Scrum Roles:
     o Scrum Master (Scrum Lead): Facilitator of the Scrum Ceremonies (meetings) and ensure that 
     proper Scrum practices are being followed by the team.
     o (Full) Scrum Team: This is the full cross-functional team that will include the BAs, Product Owner,
     Quality Assurance/Analysts and developers etc. 
     o Product Owner: This is the person who represents the end client or users for the product. 
     may be the client themselves or a representative
     o Scrum Development Team: subset of the Scrum team that is composed of just the developers 
     (and maybe some specialized technical members like testers.) 

     Scrum Ceremonies (meetings): 
     o Sprint Planning Meeting:
     o Daily Standups: These are daily meetings of the Scrum Development team that 
     should not last longer than 15 minutes. Each team member will discuss what they have worked on 
     since the last stand up and what they intend to do until the next stand up. 

     This is also where “blockers” are declared. 
     ▪ Blockers are issues that are encountered during development that are slowing the progress of development.
     Technically a blocker is only a blocker if the problem is out of the control of the developer. 

    Kanban: 
     This an Agile implementation that uses a visual board to track development projects. 
     The board show user stories or other tasks as “cards”. 
     Cards will move horizontally across the board in different columns that represent the different 
        steps of the SDLC. 
     Each developer should be working on a single card at a time.

    Scumban: 
     Scrumban is an Agile implementation that combines Scrum and Kanban
     allowing the easy visibility of progress and assurances that duplicate efforts are not made.
