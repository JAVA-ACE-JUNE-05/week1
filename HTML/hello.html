hypertext markup langugae
->hyper text are the blue underlined text that when we click it will take us to a new page
->markup language is said to be a "tag" based language

HTML IS THE STRUCTURE OF THE BROWSER PAGE (BUILDING BLOCK OF A HUGE BUILDING)

HTML: is divided into 3 parts
HEAD - BODY - FOOTER

opening              closing
<html>               </html>

HTML IS NOT CASE SENSITIVE
<HTMl></HTMl>
<html></html>
these both are completely same in html language

-----------------------------------OPENING OF HTML PAGE--------------------------------------------------
 <!DOCTYPE html>  this is to tell the browser this is a html 5 
 <html lang="en"> this is to tell the browser that page should be rendered in english langugage

-----------------------------------SECTION-1------------------------------------------------------------
 <head> the head tag is something we cannot see, but its how my browser page will act.
   <meta charset="UTF-8">   this means that meta character set is unicode transformation format - 8 
                            (there is 32 and 64 too but 8 takes less space)
                            so my page will consist of diff characters(-+ABCabc etc) so the should be rendered correctly 
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                            this tells my browser that the page should be fitted with any device that it can change the 
                            width and height accordingly (initial scale means, 1.0 represents 100% zoom)
   <title>Document</title>  this is the browser window name that my page will have
 </head>
----------------------------------SECTION-2--------------------------------------------------------------
 <body>
   <p>LOREM50</p>  it can generate some dumpy text we can change the number of words
