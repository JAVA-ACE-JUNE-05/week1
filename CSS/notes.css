/* 

    CSS stands for: Cascading style sheets 

    HTML WAS THE STRUCTURE BUT CSS ADDS STYLE TO THAT STRUCTURE

    Shortcut:
    div.container
    to make a automatic div class of container
    div#first
    to make a automatic div id of first

    we can style the page using 3 ways
    1- on the head tag calling each element (style tag)
    2- inline of the element (inline css)
    3- creating a css sheet and calling the element (external css)

    Html id and class attributes:
    when an html element is given and id it serves as a unique ientifier
    when a html element is given an class it now belongs to that class(more than one lement can belong to a same class)
    not the same case with id 
    
    p class = "cat dog fish"
    paragraph belongs to 3 diff classes now by utilizing space in between

    # is used for id
    . is used for class
    
    CSS SELECTORS:
    id 
    class
    element
    * 

    p , h1 {
    this css style will work we can add multiple like this
    }

    css priortize:
    1- inline style first
    2- style tag in head tag  
    3- css style sheet  

    css is known to be working with key value pairs
    p           class = "cat dog fish"
                key         value

    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    m0+p0 use this shortcut to do the same work

    body{
    background-image: url(penguinimg.jpg);
    }

    CSS BOX MODEL
    The 4 regions of the box model are from inner to outer: 
    o Content: the actual content of the element. 
    o Padding: this is generally empty space between the content and the border. 
    o Border: This region allows for the CSS border styling. 
    o Margin: This is generally empty space between the border and the margin of the next element.

    we use box model to manipulate the content inside it according to your specifications


    display â€“ allows you to set if an element functions as a block or inline element.

    CSS FRAMEWORK:

    Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework. It is a class-based framework meaning that styling is 
    applied using HTML classes. 
    Note: because classes are highly specific, this means that overriding Bootstrap in instances where 
    you wish to apply custom styling can be difficult.

    can connect bootstrap by using the global link in bootstrap official website
    link in head tag 

    note: we can link multiple files with html at the same time..
